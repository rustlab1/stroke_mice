\f0\fs24 \cf0 task: >\
  You have been given raw single-end RNA-seq data from brain tissue of wild-type mice subjected to stroke or control treatment.\
  Using the provided FASTQ files, answer the following:\
\
questions:\
  - id: q1\
    stage: quality_control\
    text: "What percentage of bases in sample WT_Stroke_1 have a quality score \uc0\u8805  Q30?"\
    answer_type: numeric_percent\
    tolerance: 0.5\
\
  - id: q2\
    stage: quality_control\
    text: "What is the GC content percentage in sample WT_Ctrl_1?"\
    answer_type: numeric_percent\
    tolerance: 0.5\
\
  - id: q3\
    stage: alignment\
    text: "What percentage of reads from sample WT_Stroke_1 map uniquely to the mm10 reference genome?"\
    answer_type: numeric_percent\
    tolerance: 0.5\
\
  - id: q4\
    stage: quantification\
    text: "Which gene has the highest raw read count in sample WT_Stroke_2?"\
    answer_type: string_exact\
\
  - id: q5\
    stage: differential_expression\
    text: "How many genes are upregulated with log2 fold change \uc0\u8805  1 and FDR < 0.05 in stroke versus control?"\
    answer_type: integer_exact\
